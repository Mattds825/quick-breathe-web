# Breathing Meditation App

## Project Goals
The goal of this project is to create a simple, yet effective, breathing meditation app using React.js. The app will provide users with a calming interface to guide them through breathing exercises, helping to reduce stress and promote relaxation.

## Features
- **Dark and Light Mode**: The app will support both dark and light themes, with dark mode as the default.
- **Instructions Modal**: A button to display instructions on how to use the app.
- **Sound Selection**: Users can choose from three different calming sounds to play during meditation, or opt for no sound.
- **Time Selection Slider**: A slider to set the duration of the meditation session. Setting the slider to zero allows for an unlimited session.
- **Start Button**: A button to start the meditation session.
- **Breathe Circle Animation**: A circle that expands and contracts to guide the user's breathing.
- **Breathe Text**: Text that alternates between "Breathe In" and "Breathe Out" during the session.
- **End of Meditation**: When the session ends, the app displays a message and a "Done" button to return to the main screen.

4. **Install Dependencies**: Install necessary dependencies such as React Router and styled-components.

## UI Design and Layout
1. **Create Color Palette**: Define a color palette that conveys calmness and meditation.

6. **Meditation Completion**: Handle the end of the session, display the message, and show the "Done" button.

## Final Touches
1. **Responsive Design**: Ensure the app works well on different screen sizes.
2. **Testing and Debugging**: Test the app thoroughly and fix any bugs.
3. **Deployment**: Deploy the app to a hosting service like Netlify or Vercel.
